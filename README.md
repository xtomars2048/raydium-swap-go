## Description
This repository is not an SDK. It merely serves as an example how to swap using Raydium in the Go. I am relatively new to Go, so I may not be fully proficient in its mechanics. Feel free to suggest any improvements or changes you think would enhance the code.

## How to use?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xtomars2048/raydium-swap-go.git
cd raydium-swap-go
export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY = "someimportantprivatekey"
export RPC_URL = "https://..."
go run .
```
## How to change tokens and amount ?

```javascript
// All changed should be done in run.go

executeTransaction := false // change this to true if you want to execute real transaction. Yes Real.

inputToken := utils.NewToken("SOL", "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112", 9) // You can change this to any token which you want to sell
outputToken := utils.NewToken("RAY", "4k3Dyjzvzp8eMZWUXbBCjEvwSkkk59S5iCNLY3QrkX6R", 6) // You can change this to any token which you want to buy

slippage := utils.NewPercent(1, 100) // // this means 1% slippage, if you want to set this to 0.5 change this to utils.NewPercent(5, 1000)


amount := utils.NewTokenAmount(inputToken, 0.1) // Swap amount (0.1 sol)
```

## Common erorrs
- Pool not found
  - Solution
    - change this 
      ```javascript
      poolKeys, err := raydium.Pool.GetPoolKeys(inputToken.Mint, outputToken.Mint)
      ```
      to this
      ```javascript
      poolKeys, err := raydium.Pool.GetPoolKeys(outputToken.Mint, inputToken.Mint)
      ```
- pool info unavailable
  - This means pool not ready for swap or just try again
